I have a vision for where I want to take this project, but since I have finals tomorrow i'll just get a basic schematic whipped up (i have no idea what i'm doing)

I did not in fact get anything done but finals are over so i can probably actually get started today
hear me out tabletop flat design cause i'm scared of 90Â°, plate for mx switches and an oled cause i'm overconfident, but first let's get a basic pcb done
wait no hear me out: rotary encoder. to encode your rotary movement. amirite amirite?
