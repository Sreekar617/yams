I have a vision for where I want to take this project, but since I have finals tomorrow i'll just get a basic schematic whipped up (i have no idea what i'm doing)<br>
**literally like 30 seconds spent ðŸ˜­**

I did not in fact get anything done but finals are over so i can probably actually get started today<br>
hear me out tabletop flat design cause i'm scared of 90Â°, plate for mx switches and an oled cause i'm overconfident, but first let's get a basic pcb done<br>
wait no hear me out: rotary encoder. to encode your rotary movement. amirite amirite?<br>
**1 hour spent**

ok time to wire up the oled and rotary encoder<br>
zawg how do i power ts<br>
ohhhh now i know the difference between vsys, vbus, and 3v3<br>
it's all wired in the schematic :yay:<br>
now time to find a speaker that's loud and preferably not expensive (good cheap fast ahh)<br>
oops i had the times i spent written in obsidian but not here better add those in<br>
**2 hours spent**
